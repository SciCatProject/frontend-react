# SciCat Frontend React

This project serves as a proof of concept for SciCat frontend built using the React framework. It is designed as a data catalog web application with advanced filtering and customization features for datasets.

## Features
### Searchable Interface
The application provides users with a search interface to explore datasets within the catalog. Users can enter keywords to search for specific datasets, making it easier to find relevant information.

### Advanced Filtering
Users can apply various filters to refine their search results. Filters include options such as type, creation location, and owner group, allowing users to narrow down their selections based on specific criteria.

### Customizable Data Table
The data table component offers extensive customization options for users. They can drag and drop columns to rearrange their order, resize columns for better visibility, and hide/show columns based on their preferences.

## Future Enhancements
While this proof of concept demonstrates the core functionalities of the data catalog web application, there are several areas for future improvement:

**User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and login functionality. <br>
**Enhanced Dataset Information:** Provide additional details and metadata about selected datasets, enhancing the user experience and understanding of the data.

## Technologies Used
The project leverages the following technologies and libraries:

**React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. <br>
**Typescript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity. <br>
**Material-UI (MUI):** A popular React UI framework that provides pre-designed components and styles for building modern web applications. <br>
**mui-datatables:** A customizable data table component for React applications, offering advanced features for displaying and managing tabular data.
